# 06_Python_Object_Class

## Introduction üëã

Objected oriented programming as a discipline has gained a universal following among developers. Python, an in-demand programming language also follows an object-oriented programming paradigm. It deals with declaring Python classes and objects which lays the foundation of OOPs concepts. This article on ‚Äúobject oriented programming python‚Äù will walk you through declaring python classes, instantiating objects from them along with the four methodologies of OOPs.

## Frequently asked questions ‚ùî

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can ‚≠ê star this tutorial. Starring is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/06_Python_Object_Class) if you aren't here already and click the "‚≠ê Star" button in the top right corner. You will be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? ü§î

1. Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/06_Python_Object_Class) if you aren't here already.
    
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of the page, then click "[Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/06_Python_Object_Class/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)".

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
4. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Cell > All Output > Clear`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
