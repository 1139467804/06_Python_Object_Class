    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **“objects”**. The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* attributes\n",
    "* behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "* singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object. A class is a blueprint for the object. To create an object we require a model or plan or blueprint which is nothing but class.\n",

    "**Class represents the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. Properties represent variables, and actions are represented by the methods. Hence class contains both variables and methods.**\n",
    "\n",
